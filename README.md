# Front End

### Roadmap

Starting with the basics: 
  <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>Nodejs</li>

<br>
Alittle More Complex
  <li>React or some other js framework / library </li>
  <li>Deployment on any given platform that's trendy and secure</li>
  <li>Going back to Ruby because there's so much legacy to be taken care of.</li>
